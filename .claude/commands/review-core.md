---

Review the `packages/core/src/index.ts` file and identify:

1. TypeScript type errors or inconsistencies
2. API design issues
3. Missing functionality for a complete AST implementation
4. Opportunities for improvement
5. Any deviations from the design in CLAUDE.md

Provide specific, actionable recommendations for fixes.
