description: Show project status and next steps

Provide a comprehensive status report for the dastardly project:

1. List all existing packages and their status (built/not built, tested/not tested)
2. Check what phase we're currently in (refer to CLAUDE.md)
3. List the next 3-5 concrete tasks that should be done
4. Identify any blocking issues or missing dependencies
5. Show recent git commits (if in a git repo)
